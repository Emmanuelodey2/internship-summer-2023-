/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

a. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
b. Calculate both their BMIs
c. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
d. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3  (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true"). 

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
